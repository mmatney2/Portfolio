            My kids are <i><b>everything</b></i> to me. I want them to know they can do anything! And when I get through this course, 
            I'll know I can do anything and they will, TOO! Being a developer will be very rewarding for me in this way and many more ways.
            The work I do will impact the reputation and the success of the companies I help.
            When I was in college, I thought I wanted to be a doctor until I took anatomy. That was 16 years ago when I graduated 
            with a biology degree. As a software engineer, I feel I can have just as much impact on businesses full of people, as a doctor 
            has on a hospital full of patients. Because of all these reasons, I can't wait to get started!

            <h1>My Background</h1>
            <strong><small>A little bit about me... </small></strong>
        <p>
            I grew up in Plymouth, Michigan, not too far from Ann Arbor and Detroit, Michigan. I'm my parent's middle child of five children.
            My parents also have nine grandchildren! My father is a retired engineer from Ford Motor Company and my mother is a retired assembly 
            line worker and home-maker at General Motor Company. They met on the job. </p>
            <p>After graduating Michigan State University in 2006 with a 
            Biology Degree, I started my career in brewing science at MillerCoors. After being laid-off twice due to company down-sizing, I 
            started my Real Estate Sales career in 2014. That was an adventure I'll never forget! From that career change, I gained lots of 
            confidence and made a lot of close friends that I still have today. I realized lots of people actually go through career changes.
